      <p className="mb-4">
        I'm a backend-focused developer passionate about building scalable,
        reliable web applications.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        My core expertise lies in{" "}
        <span className="text-orange-300 font-bold">backend development</span>{" "}
        using{" "}
        <span className="text-orange-300 font-bold">Django and Express</span>,
        where Iâ€™ve worked extensively with REST APIs, database design,
        authentication systems, and background jobs.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        That said, I also love crafting intuitive user interfaces with{" "}
        <span className="text-orange-300 font-bold">React</span>, and often
        build full-stack apps from scratch to bring my ideas to life. While
        backend is my strength, I'm always eager to contribute to frontend when
        the project needs it.

      <p className="mb-4">
        Previously, I worked with{" "}
        <span className="text-orange-300 font-bold">.NET</span> technologies,
        where I built desktop applications and performed API integrations â€”
        giving me a strong foundation in backend logic and system design.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I'm driven by solving real-world problems, optimizing performance, and I
        especially love cron jobs for background automation!
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Currently, I'm actively looking for backend roles or React roles where I
        can grow and contribute to meaningful software products.

        Outside coding, Iâ€™m usually reading fiction books, learning new tech, or
